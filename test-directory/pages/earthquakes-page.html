            Earthquakes
            ===========
            
            Kobe, Japan (an MEDC)
            ---------------------
            
            Earthquakes are a constant threat for Japan. One of these earthquakes
            was the November 17, 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan (magnitude 7.5). Kobe was the
            closest major city to the epicenter.
            
            Kobe is on the Nojima Fault, a minor fault, above the destructive
            boundary between the Philippines Plate (oceanic) and Eurasian
            Plate (continental). The resulting volcanic activity created the
            Japanese island arc. These earth movements can also cause severe
            earthquakes.
            
            ### Impact
            
            Primary effects
            
            * almost 200,000 collapsed buildings
            * 1 km of the elevated Hanshin Expressway collapsed
            * several bridges on a 130 km stretch of the bullet train course
            * several trains on lesser lines derailed
            
            Secondary effects
            
            * electricity/gas/water supply interrupted
            * roads were congested, so emergency vehicles were delayed
            * people were afraid to return because of the aftershocks
            
            There were 5500 deaths, 40,000 injuries, and 180,000 houses
            destroyed.
            
            ### Response
            
            * Kobe’s infrastructure was working again by July
            * Rail services were again operational by August
            * New buildings had to meet higher earthquake-resistance criteria
            
            Sichuan, China (an LEDC)
            ------------------------
            
            On May 12, 2008, a magnitude 7.9 happened in Sichuan, China.
            
            ### Causes
            
            The north-west of the Sichuan province is on a major fault between
            the Indo-Australian and Eurasian Plates. The Indo-Australian Plate
            moves into the Eurasian Plate, increasing pressure at the fault.
            
            ### Background
            
            Health care/education/communications were not very developed, and
            not as capable of managing a major earthquake. Many houses were not
            built for earthquakes. Many schools were poorly built.
            
            Some areas didn’t have phone service and therefore were more isolated.
            
            There is a high population density because most of Sichuan
            (excluding the north-western part) is a comparatively level,
            low-lying river basin with fertile soil that gives high rice
            yields.

            ### Impact
            
            * 69,227 dead
            * 18,000 missing
            * Over 46 million people affected
            * Over 19,000 schoolchildren died
            
            ### Response
            
            * Within hours, 20 helicopters in addition to 1300 soldiers were
              sent to the area
            * On the 14th, soldiers reached the affected area
            * On the 15th, an additional 90 helicopters transported
              food, water, and medical supplies to the area; they also removed
              the worst-injured from the area
